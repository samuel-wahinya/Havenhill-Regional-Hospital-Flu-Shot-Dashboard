## 1) Project Background

As a **Data Analyst at Havenhill Regional Hospital**, I support clinical and administrative teams by turning healthcare data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and hospital operations. 

In 2022, the hospital prioritized increasing uptake of the **seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine**‚Äîa critical preventive measure for high-risk populations including the elderly, young children, and individuals with chronic illnesses.

To aid this public health effort, I was tasked with building a **Seasonal Flu Vaccination Dashboard** using our internal hospital data. This dashboard would visualize:
- Vaccination trends over time
- Coverage across different demographics
- Geographic distribution across counties
- A full patient-level breakdown of those who received or missed the flu shot

This project utilized:
- **SQL Server** for data extraction and transformation
  - [Pull Required Columns - `flu_shot_2022.sql`](script/flu_shot_2022.sql)
  - [Perform Quality Checks - `flu_shot_2022_quality_check.sql`](script/flu_shot_2022_quality_check.sql)
  - [Clean and Standardize Data - `flu_shot_2022_data_cleaning.sql`](script/flu_shot_2022_data_cleaning.sql)  
- **Tableau** for interactive data visualization

The resulting dashboard is now a central resource used by Havenhill‚Äôs medical directors and community outreach teams to identify underserved groups, evaluate performance, and drive targeted vaccination efforts.

## 2) Data Structure

The data for this project was extracted from Havenhill Regional Hospital‚Äôs internal relational database, which follows a normalized structure. Below is an overview of the key tables used:

### Core Tables

- **Patients**
  - Contains demographic details such as name, birth date, race, county, and death date.
  
- **Encounters**
  - Records patient visits to the hospital, including start and stop times.

- **Immunizations**
  - Logs administered vaccines, with codes identifying the vaccine type (e.g., flu shots use code `5302`).

### üß† Key Insights

- **Total Flu Shots Administered**  
  A total of **8,101** flu shots were given to eligible patients, reflecting strong hospital engagement in public health.

- **Overall Compliance Rate**  
  **81.4%** of active patients received their flu shots in 2022, indicating high awareness and access to immunizations.

- **Vaccination by Age Group**  
  - Ages **0‚Äì17** and **50‚Äì64** had the **highest compliance** (92.1% and 94%), possibly due to school requirements and senior care initiatives.  
  - Ages **18‚Äì49** showed **lower uptake**, highlighting an opportunity for targeted awareness campaigns among younger adults.

- **Vaccination by Race**  
  Compliance was **consistently above 80%** across all racial groups, with **Native Americans (85.7%)** and **Black patients (84.9%)** having the highest rates.

- **Vaccination by County**  
  Counties like **Barnstable** (82.5%) and **Berkshire** (82.3%) led in compliance, while **Dukes** and **Nantucket** (80%) show room for slight improvement through localized outreach.

## 4) Recommendations

1. **Target Awareness for Young Adults (18‚Äì49)**  
   Patients aged **18‚Äì34** (65.8% compliance) and **35‚Äì49** (67.6% compliance) showed the lowest flu shot uptake compared to other age groups.  
   ‚ûî Launch focused educational campaigns and workplace initiatives for this group, highlighting that even healthy adults benefit from annual flu vaccinations.

2. **Outreach in Lower-Compliant Counties**  
   While most counties showed flu shot compliance above 82%, **Dukes** and **Nantucket counties** lagged behind at **80% compliance**.  
   ‚ûî Consider deploying mobile clinics, partnering with local organizations, or hosting pop-up vaccination events to improve access and awareness.

3. **Earlier and Sustained Campaign Rollout**  
   With an overall compliance of **81.4%**, a stronger push earlier in the flu season could boost numbers.  
   ‚ûî Initiate flu shot awareness campaigns and appointment scheduling at the **start of Q3**. Reinforce with reminder systems via SMS, email, or patient portal notifications to maximize patient follow-through.

4. **Collaborate with Community Leaders**  
   Strong compliance was observed among the **0‚Äì17** (92.1%) and **65+** (91.6%) age groups, likely due to existing community outreach efforts.  
   ‚ûî Deepen partnerships with schools, local churches, and elder care centers to maintain high vaccination rates among youth and seniors, while expanding reach to mid-aged adults.
